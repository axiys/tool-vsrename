Rename Visual Studio projects, namespaces, filename and so on with ease.

This allows you to rename Visual Studio projects. There are two stages in renaming projects:

1) Rename directories and files (ignores .git/ .svn/ .nuget/ packages/ obj/ bin/ paths):
	vsrename . OldProjectName NewProjectName

2) Rename the content including solution to the new name  
	vsrename . OldProjectName NewProjectName true *.*

VSRename.exe <path> <find> <replace with> [<true - only search and replace file content> <only files with extension>]
